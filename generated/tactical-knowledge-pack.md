## Architecture

Hermes/frontier model authors or selects typed tactical plans; deterministic host validates, confirms, executes, and serves replay.

MCP role: Thin Hermes adapter over the host-owned application service; not a runtime, database, or permission layer.
Initial MCP transport: `local stdio`

## Recipes

### Ball-Side Block Shift (`ball_side_block_shift_v1`)

State: `APPROVED`

Find possessions where the ball enters a wide channel and the defending outfield block shifts toward that side under the frozen M1 semantics.

Allowed claims:

- The ball entered a configured wide area.
- The defending outfield centroid shifted toward the ball side by the configured threshold.
- The subsequent outcome was SWITCHED, RETAINED_NO_SWITCH, LOST_BEFORE_SWITCH, or excluded STOPPAGE under the frozen predicates.
- The replay coordinates come from canonical 25 Hz source frames.

Disallowed claims:

- The attack intentionally caused the shift.
- A switch was always available.
- Not switching was a mistake.
- The moment proves an optimal decision or missed opportunity.
- The result is backed by licensed match video.

### Possession Corridor Availability (`possession_corridor_availability_v1`)

State: `EXPERIMENTAL`

Experimental composition that starts from ordinary possession anchors and detects whether a geometric progressive corridor appears without using the M1 wide-entry block-shift spine.

Allowed claims:

- The team had an active-ball possession anchor.
- A geometric progressive corridor appeared under the configured relation thresholds.
- The replay coordinates come from canonical 25 Hz source frames.

Disallowed claims:

- The attack intentionally created the corridor.
- A pass should have been played.
- The corridor is optimal.
- The result is a pass probability, decision-quality, causation, player-intent, or missed-opportunity claim.
- The result is backed by licensed match video.

### Opposite Corridor After Shift (`opposite_corridor_after_shift_v1`)

State: `EXPERIMENTAL`

Experimental composition that finds wide-entry block shifts, evaluates opposite-side geometric progressive corridors, and classifies whether the ball enters the corridor destination region.

Allowed claims:

- The ball entered a configured wide area.
- The defending outfield centroid shifted toward the ball side by the configured threshold.
- A geometric progressive corridor appeared on the opposite side under the configured relation thresholds.
- The ball either entered or did not enter the selected corridor destination region within the configured horizon.
- The replay coordinates come from canonical 25 Hz source frames.

Disallowed claims:

- The attack intentionally created the corridor.
- A pass should have been played.
- The corridor is optimal.
- The result is a pass probability, decision-quality, causation, player-intent, or missed-opportunity claim.
- The result is backed by licensed match video.

## Ambiguity Dimensions

- `SUPPORT_DEFINITION`: Clarify what support means: corridor, nearby teammate, receiving option, lane occupation, or another definition.
- `TIME_WINDOW`: Clarify when support must arrive relative to possession, carry, pass, or line break.
- `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`: Clarify proximity language with an explicit distance threshold.

## Capability Gap Codes

- `PRIMITIVE_MUTATION`: Request would alter primitive or relation definitions.
- `CONFIRMATION_BYPASS`: Request bypasses host-owned confirmation.
- `DIRECT_EXECUTION`: Request asks the agent to execute directly.
- `PLAYER_INTENT`: Tracking data cannot prove player intent.
- `BODY_ORIENTATION`: No body-orientation primitive is available.
- `SCANNING`: No head-check or scanning primitive is available.
- `PASS_PROBABILITY`: Pass-probability modelling is not available.
- `OPTIMALITY`: Optimal decision claims are out of scope.
- `COMMUNICATION`: Communication is not represented in tracking data.
- `VIDEO`: Video is outside the current data boundary.
- `BODY_SHAPE`: No body-shape primitive is available.
- `DECEPTION`: Deception is not observable in current deterministic vocabulary.
- `COACH_INSTRUCTIONS`: Coach instruction evidence is unavailable.
- `FACIAL_CUES`: Facial cues are unavailable without video/perception.
